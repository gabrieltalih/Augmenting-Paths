How to run the code:

Put all classes in your source folder. If in vscode, just the main directory.

After, add two extra folders called "Input Files" and "Output Files" to read and write the files
from and to (They should be wherever your main directory of your project is).

Finally, run the Driver.java class.

The program has 3 modes, one to read a file of an already generated graph, one to
create a graph with user specified parameters, and finally one to generate graphs based
on prechosen parameters. The second and third mode will also create files for the generated
graphs.

All generated graphs are placed in the Output Files folder, while all files to be read should
be in the Input Files folder. Note that files may be overwritten if program is called multiple
times and the files created have the same name/parameters in multiple runs.
